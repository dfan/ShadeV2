# ShadeV2
My group's final project in AP Comp Sci. An attempt at creating a simple platformer game
Basically the character can jump and land on certain obstacles. Wasn't enough time to add other functionalities to the game. All graphics were made by us in Photoshop (surprisingly pretty)
** must compile with at least Java JDK 8. the file extensions .jc_ are just files created by JCreator Pro, the IDE used in AP CS class. You can delete them and just add the java files to your project in Eclipse or whatever
